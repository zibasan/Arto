**Arto — the Art of Reading Markdown.**

A local app that faithfully recreates GitHub-style Markdown rendering for a beautiful reading experience.

## Philosophy

Markdown has become more than a lightweight markup language — it's the medium for documentation, communication, and thinking in the developer's world. While most tools focus on _writing_ Markdown, **Arto is designed for _reading_ it beautifully**.

The name "Arto" comes from "Art of Reading" — reflecting the philosophy that reading Markdown is not just a utility task, but a quiet, deliberate act of understanding and appreciation.

Arto faithfully reproduces GitHub's Markdown rendering in a local, offline environment, offering a calm and precise reading experience with thoughtful typography and balanced whitespace.

## Installation

Use [Homebrew] tap to install. Since the application is not signed or notarized with an Apple Developer ID, you'll need to remove the quarantine attribute after installation.
See [homebrew-tap] for more information.

```
brew install --cask arto-app/tap/arto
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Arto.app
```

Alternatively, [Nix] is also supported.
To try it without a permanent installation:

```
nix run github:arto-app/Arto
```

For a permanent installation, use [nix-darwin] or [home-manager].
Add the following to your flake inputs:

```nix
arto.url = "github:arto-app/Arto";
```

Then add it to `environment.systemPackages` (nix-darwin) or `home.packages` (home-manager):

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.arto.packages.${system}.default ];
```

Launch the application to see the welcome screen with keyboard shortcuts and usage instructions.

## Usage

After installation, the `arto` command becomes available in your terminal:

```
arto                     # Launch Arto (shows welcome screen)
arto README.md           # Open a specific file
arto --open=screen README.md
arto --open=new README.md
arto --directory=. README.md
arto docs/               # Open a directory in the file explorer
arto file1.md file2.md   # Open multiple files in tabs
```

Arto runs as a **single instance** — if Arto is already running, the command sends requests to the existing process instead of launching a new one.

- `arto FILE` uses `last_focused` behavior by default (reuse last focused visible window).
- `--open=screen` opens on/reuses a visible window on the cursor's current screen.
- `--open=new` always opens in a new window.
- `--directory=DIR` sets the FileExplorer root directory for that invocation.
- Positional directory arguments (e.g. `arto docs/`) also set the root directory.
- Running `arto` without arguments shows/focuses an existing window if hidden, or opens one if none exists.

# Contributing to Arto

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Arto!

## Development Setup

### Recommended: Using Nix (Reproducible Environment)

[Nix] provides a fully reproducible development environment with all dependencies pre-configured. This is the recommended approach as it ensures consistent tooling across all contributors.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arto-app/Arto.git
cd Arto
cachix use arto   # Enable binary cache (speeds up builds)
nix develop
```

This automatically provides:
- Rust toolchain with required targets
- pnpm for frontend dependencies
- just command runner
- dioxus-cli for development
- All other required tools

[Nix]: https://nixos.org/

### Alternative: Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use Nix, install these prerequisites manually:

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) (stable toolchain)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [dioxus-cli](https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-cli)

Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arto-app/Arto.git
cd Arto
just setup
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run in development mode
cargo run --release

# Run with hot-reload (requires dioxus-cli)
dx serve --platform desktop

# Format, lint, and test
just fmt check test
```

## Production Build

```bash
# Build for macOS
just build

# Install to /Applications (macOS)
just install
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/arto` or `target/dx/arto/bundle/macos/bundle/`.

## Code Style

- **Rust**: Follow standard Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- **Comments**: Must be in English
- **Tests**: Use `indoc` crate for multi-line test strings
- **Module System**: Use Rust 2018+ style (no `mod.rs`)
